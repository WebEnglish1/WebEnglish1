                  There are people who find reading a big challenge. Some of the causes of reading difficulties can be personal 
                  such as a small concentration span, surrounding noise, not understanding what you are reading among other 
                  reasons. When learning English it’s encouraged to read because a lot of knowledge is found in books. <br><br>

                 Web English thrives on the success of English learners therefore we decided to write a few tips that might 
                 contribute to help learners to improve reading. Most books are written in English among them novels, magazines,
                  textbooks and so on. When you read you might improve your English. You might want to read the list below your 
                  reading habits might improve. <br> <br>
                  
                  
                  <a href="index.html#signup"  class="btn btn-block btn-dark rounded-0 my-3 text-light" role="button" style="font-family: Calibri">Web English</a><br>
                 
  
                  
                  1.	Breaks<br><br>
                  When you read for a long time without resting you begin to lose concentration. When you lose concentration 
                  you don’t understand. We read to know what’s written, that’s the aim. The tip here is to stop reading after a
                   few pages. Quantify this with time. After every 1 hour stop reading to breathe, take a few steps away from the 
                   reading space and come back to think about what you read the previous hour before you carry on.  When you take 
                   a break you can do something to distract yourself from the reading, such as a few stretches, making a cup of 
                   tea, drinking water, etc. This way you reduce pressure on your brain to keep learning for a long time.<br><br>

                   2.	Surroundings<br><br>
                  Your surroundings have a huge impact on how you reading. Some people don’t like noise when reading others can’t
                   read well when there is extreme silence. Light also contributes to how surroundings might affect a reader. It 
                   can’t be too bright e.g. reading in the sun. Dim light can affect your eyes when reading. To correct the 
                   factors mentioned find the correct environment. A quiet place is ideal for reading, playing soft music while 
                   you read can also help. Get in a room with proper lighting to help with brightness. When you consider this, 
                   reading can produce better results for any person at any age.
                  
                  <br><br>
                  
                  <a href="index.html#signup"  class="btn btn-block btn-dark rounded-0 my-3 text-light" role="button" style="font-family: Calibri">Web English</a><br>
                 

                  3.	Time<br><br>
                  Time matters when reading. Depending on where you are, it might be home, work or school. There is time when 
                  it’s not conducive to read. At home try not to read when people are making noise, when others are doing 
                  something you find interesting or when time for your favourite show on radio. At school break time is not a 
                  good time to read. These are examples, you know your schedule better. Select a consistent time with minimum 
                  distractions to read.<br><br>

                  4.	Collection<br><br>
                  Read books you understand. These might be books with examples, illustrations, pictures and language you prefer,
                   hoping you prefer English this is an English learner’s platform. When you are 10 years old don’t read 
                   University text books there is no need for that. When you are a social scientist it’s better to read History 
                   than to read books related to Quantum Physics. <br><br>

                  5.	Comprehension<br><br>
                  Understanding has been a big topic on this blog. When in the middle of reading and you come across a word you 
                  have never seen before, stop. When you stop look up the word and understand what it means. English has many 
                  words, we can’t understand them all. When you know the meaning then carry on, this way you don’t get lost while
                   reading. Your reading experience becomes more stimulating. Do you know what stimulating means? Look it up when 
                   you don’t.<br><br>
