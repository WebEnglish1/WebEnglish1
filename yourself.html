                  It’s particularly important to English learners to be themselves because you 
                  mustn’t be shy to speak English in front of others when learning, for fear of
                   getting laughed at. You also need to speak without copying anybody who speaks English you admire. We hear the words “be yourself” often from parents, mentors, teachers, etc. This might be a topic you are tired of listening to, I feel your pain pal. Don’t rush to judge yet you are going to find this blog post interesting.

                 <div class="">Source: Pixabay</div><br>
  
                 Let’s get straight to the point. When you try to be somebody else you deprive the 
                 world of something special. An important part of the universe that has a great 
                 role to play, a duty to serve, character to expose & a void to fill. The moment
                  you mimic another person you lose your true character to produce two unnecessary
                   similar characters. Between these two characters the second is fake & can never 
                   beat the first at shining.

                  It’s advisable to notice your best traits & abilities. We all possess such characters. The difference between people who excel better & those who don’t is that people who excel know what they do best, show contentment & focus on improving what they are naturally good at. When you notice your best abilities focus on them to develop yourself. Focused self-improvement can get an individual far. Below are a few things that we need to pay less attention to because they encourage people to mimic others.
                  <br><br>1.	Peer pressure<br><br>
When you allow the people you spend most of you time with, people such as friends, colleagues, siblings, etc. to discourage you from following your heart you have lost yourself. Believe in your own ideas no matter how much the next person discourages you, when you don’t do well you know I have made my own mistake. This can help you develop your own character to become a better person.


                  <br><br>

                  <a href="index.html#signup"  class="btn btn-block btn-dark rounded-0 my-3 text-light" role="button" style="font-family: Calibri">Web English</a><br>
                    
                  
                  2. No contentment<br><br>
A content person appreciates what's regarded as trivial by most. When you are this kind of person you do better. Your appreciation of your least abilities can help you grow to something great. You get what you give. Appreciate to get appreciated.
<br><br>3. Trying to fit in<br><br>
Your popular neighbour is not better than you they only have access to more people perhaps because they true to themselves. We don’t all need to be popular. There is a place for everyone. When you try to fit in a group of people by copying how they do things & forget yourself, that won’t help anybody. Who you are copying might lose the true you, who is obviously better than the fake you & you lose your best character. Who wants that?
<br><br>To conclude this article, be yourself. Painting a bee black, instructing it to lose weight & telling it to chill in the toilet does not help anybody. Let a bee, be a bee & a fly be a fly.
