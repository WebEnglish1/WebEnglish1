                  What is computer literacy? Perhaps you asked this question when you opened this web page.
                   We are here to serve. Here is a quick explanation to this phrase before we 
                   explain its relationship with English.  Computer literacy is an understanding 
                   of the basic operation of a computer. This comprise of powering on a computer, 
                   writing documents, installing applications, browsing the internet, etc.

                 A person can be considered computer literate when they can perform the mentioned
                  tasks at a beginner level. You don’t have to be an IT professional to be computer
                   literate. The modern world demands computer literacy. Many essential products
                    and services in addition to entertainment can now be found on the internet.

                  You can only utilize the internet effectively when you have computer literacy. Most jobs need computer literate individuals. A person who has read a job placement advertisement might have seen this as a requirement for getting employed. We have compiled a list of explanations to the relationship between computer literacy and English. 
<br><br>1.	Documents<br><br>
Many documents are written in English. School reports, University assignments, work memos, application letters, cover letters, resumes, CVs, etc. Most of these documents are not hand written. It’s a requirement that some of these documents are typed to be printed. An individual who doesn’t know how to operate a computer might struggle to write these documents. When you have no computer literacy and unable to write proper English you can survive however you’ll struggle.

<br><br>2.	Emails<br><br>
Emails are an important part of most official business. Schools and work places have been relying on email services for a long time. When people email each other they communicate in English. There is common English language written when people communicate by email. This closely relates the language to computer literacy.

                  <a href="index.html#signup"  class="btn btn-block btn-dark rounded-0 my-3 text-light" role="button" style="font-family: Calibri">Web English</a>
                    
                  <br>
                  3.	Social media<br><br>
                  We have become almost inseparable from social media these days. People all over the world communicate through many social media platforms available. English is the popular language on social media whether its people in the same country connecting or not. Profile descriptions, statuses and bios are written in English. Computer literacy and English become partners this way.
                  
                  <br><br> 4.	Search engines<br><br>
                  When looking for something on the internet we search with search engines. The most efficient search results are found in English, an almost universal language. For the search Engine to understand what you are looking for you need to type English key words that are reasonable. Results to search engine queries are blogs and websites written in English. Why not sign up to Web English before we move on to the next point, to learn to improve English and computer literacy.
                  
                  <br><br>5.	Online applications<br><br>
                  When applying to a college, university, work, etc., you need to write English cover letters, CVs, share personal information in English among other things. All this need English proficiency and computer literacy.
                  There’ve been stories about people in the past going to school to learn to read and write then quit school at the moment they learn these skills. People are said to have lived their daily lives well after quitting school with writing and reading skills. Modern times demand that an individual learn to read, write and acquire computer literacy skills before they quit school to live their daily lives well.
