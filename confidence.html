                  We all need to confront the fact that we need confidence to achieve most daily 
                  tasks effectively. Something as simple as speaking can be done better when a 
                  person is confident. A person who doesn’t have confidence to speak may struggle 
                  to speak their native language. This becomes worse when speaking a language that’s
                   not your native language. It’s important to grow confidence to speak a language 
                   particularly when learning to write and speak English.

                 What makes English a language of interest is that most people in the world understand
                  enough English to communicate with others. When travelling to different parts of 
                  the world English is an ideal medium of communication. When there is a foreigner
                   in your midst it’s still an ideal medium of communication. School, work and
                    business are other places English proves ideal. This is why it’s important 
                    to speak English well. An individual can formulate their own method to improve 
                    confidence to speak. Nobody truly knows you better than you know yourself.   <br> <br>

                  Here are a few tips from Web English to improve confidence to speak English.
                  <br><br>1.	Learn <br><br>
                  Most people have an opportunity to learn English especially these days. Schools all over the world have an English department. When there is no English at your school there are private tutors and there is the internet. Web English is a great platform on the internet to learn English. When you learn from somebody who understands the language you can improve by paying attention to understand yourself. When you understand you gain confidence and speak better. Good speakers can also become good writers. You think you can’t write well while you can speak well, record yourself speaking and write your own words.
                  
                  <br><br> 2.	Practice <br><br>
                  This must’ve been the first tip because it’s a top contributor to any self-development effort. Consistent practice can help anybody improve any skill. When you repeat the same thing over a long period it becomes easy to you. At some point walking is difficult. You begin to crawl, walk around the house holding on to objects then latter begin to walk without holding anything. A grown person doesn’t worry about walking you don’t think about it because you had lots of practice. Practice to improve confidence speaking English.

                  3.	Listen<br><br>
                  Listening to people who are good at speaking English can help you improve your own English. In the end it helps to improve your confidence to speak this language. There are many places to listen. People you know, podcasts, the internet in general and television can be sources to listen to. Be careful not to listen to sources that speak broken English you might learn rubbish with confidence.

                  <br>
                  4.	Relax
                  Don’t compare yourself with other people who speak well. You can learn from others without mimicking how they sound. Trying to sound like a native English Speaker when you are not is a recipe for disaster. Keep in mind that communication is what matters. Simple words that sound simple can make you sound better than you sound when trying to copy others. Relax, breathe and don’t worry what the other person thinks about your English. Focus on communicating not impressing the next person with a fancy English accent. Get over yourself you probably didn’t grow up in England among English speaking people. Speak English to communicate well.
                  
                  <br><br>
                 
                  
                  These few tips are reminders. Anybody who has learnt English before might have come across them already. Do this and you might find yourself speaking better English. When wanting to sound better practice grammar and how to pronounce words correctly and the rest shall fall into place.
